Postmortem: E-commerce Platform Image Loading Outage
Issue Summary:
Duration: This outage occurred on Friday, May 31, 2024, from 14:23 PST to 15:07 PST (1 hour and 44 minutes).
Impact: The outage affected image loading on our e-commerce platform, impacting approximately 70% of user sessions during that time. Users experienced slow page load times and missing product images, hindering their browsing and purchasing experience.
Timeline:
14:23 PST: Anomalies were detected in our image delivery service by automated monitoring tools. These tools reported a significant increase in error rates for image requests.
14:25 PST: The on-call engineer was notified and began investigating the issue. Initial assumptions pointed towards potential network issues between our platform and the image delivery service.
14:30 PST: After investigating network connectivity and latency, the engineer determined the issue wasn't network-related. Attention shifted towards the image delivery service itself.
14:45 PST: The engineering team contacted the image delivery service provider to inquire about potential issues on their end.
14:50 PST: The image delivery service provider confirmed they were experiencing a separate service disruption impacting several clients, including our platform.
15:00 PST: While awaiting resolution from the image delivery service provider, the engineering team explored potential mitigation strategies on our end, including temporarily disabling image loading or switching to a backup image delivery service (if available).
15:05 PST: The image delivery service provider announced their issue was resolved.
15:07 PST: Our platform confirmed normal image loading functionality had resumed.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was a service disruption within our third-party image delivery service provider. This disruption caused errors when processing image requests from our platform, resulting in slow loading times and missing images for users.
The resolution involved waiting for the image delivery service provider to fix their service disruption. Once their service was restored, image loading functionality on our platform returned to normal.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improve Monitoring: Enhance monitoring capabilities to differentiate between internal platform issues and external service disruptions. This could involve implementing more granular monitoring for the image delivery service to provide faster identification of issues on their end.
Investigate Redundancy: Evaluate the feasibility of implementing a redundant image delivery service as a failover option. This would allow us to temporarily switch to a backup service in case of disruptions with the primary provider.
Communication Strategy: Develop a communication plan for future outages. This could involve establishing a clear notification process for informing internal stakeholders (engineering, customer support) and potentially implementing a user-facing notification system for major service disruptions.
Lessons Learned:
This incident highlights the importance of robust monitoring and dependency management for third-party services. By improving our monitoring and exploring redundancy options, we can aim to minimize the impact of future outages caused by external factors. Additionally, a well-defined communication strategy can ensure timely information flow during disruptions, minimizing customer frustration.
