Postmortem: E-commerce Platform Image Loading Outage
Issue Summary:
Duration: This outage occurred on Friday, May 31, 2024, from 14:23 PST to 15:07 PST (1 hour and 44 minutes).
Impact: The outage affected image loading on our e-commerce platform, impacting approximately 70% of user sessions during that time. Users experienced slow page load times and missing product images, hindering their browsing and purchasing experience.
Timeline:
14:23 PST: Anomalies were detected in our image delivery service by automated monitoring tools. These tools reported a significant increase in error rates for image requests.
14:25 PST: The on-call engineer was notified and began investigating the issue. Initial assumptions pointed towards potential network issues between our platform and the image delivery service.
14:30 PST: After investigating network connectivity and latency, the engineer determined the issue wasn't network-related. Attention shifted towards the image delivery service itself.
14:45 PST: The engineering team contacted the image delivery service provider to inquire about potential issues on their end.
14:50 PST: The image delivery service provider confirmed they were experiencing a separate service disruption impacting several clients, including our platform.
15:00 PST: While awaiting resolution from the image delivery service provider, the engineering team explored potential mitigation strategies on our end, including temporarily disabling image loading or switching to a backup image delivery service (if available).
15:05 PST: The image delivery service provider announced their issue was resolved.
15:07 PST: Our platform confirmed normal image loading functionality had resumed.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was a service disruption within our third-party image delivery service provider. This disruption caused errors when processing image requests from our platform, resulting in slow loading times and missing images for users.
The resolution involved waiting for the image delivery service provider to fix their service disruption. Once their service was restored, image loading functionality on our platform returned to normal.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improve Monitoring: Enhance monitoring capabilities to differentiate between internal platform issues and external service disruptions. This could involve implementing more granular monitoring for the image delivery service to provide faster identification of issues on their end.
Investigate Redundancy: Evaluate the feasibility of implementing a redundant image delivery service as a failover option. This would allow us to temporarily switch to a backup service in case of disruptions with the primary provider.
Communication Strategy: Develop a communication plan for future outages. This could involve establishing a clear notification process for informing internal stakeholders (engineering, customer support) and potentially implementing a user-facing notification system for major service disruptions.
Lessons Learned:
This incident highlights the importance of robust monitoring and dependency management for third-party services. By improving our monitoring and exploring redundancy options, we can aim to minimize the impact of future outages caused by external factors. Additionally, a well-defined communication strategy can ensure timely information flow during disruptions, minimizing customer frustration.



The Great Image Famine: A Postmortem Odyssey (with apologies to Homer)
Executive Summary:
Our website recently suffered a bout of image amnesia, leaving users with a bland, product-less wasteland for a grand hour and 44 minutes (Friday, May 31st, 2024, 14:23 PST - 15:07 PST). Let's just say, our conversion rates looked more like a desert than a thriving marketplace.
The Tale of the Missing Megapixels
14:23 PST: Our eagle-eyed monitoring tools swooped in and noticed a dramatic rise in image request errors. Uh oh, something fishy was going on in the image delivery department!
14:25 PST: Our trusty on-call engineer, ever the hero, sprang into action, convinced it was a network gremlin causing the chaos. Chasing after these network nasties is a favorite pastime (well, not really).
14:30 PST: After a thorough network interrogation (think pinging and tracing like a boss), the engineer realized the culprit wasn't lurking in the network shadows. The plot thickened!
14:45 PST: With suspicion shifting towards the image delivery service itself, we dispatched our most persuasive engineers to contact their support team.
14:50 PST: Turns out, our hunch was spot on! The image delivery service was experiencing a service-wide meltdown, affecting not just us, but a whole host of other online businesses. We weren't alone in this image-less purgatory!
15:00 PST: While we waited patiently (or maybe not so patiently) for the image delivery service to get their act together, our brilliant engineers hatched some creative solutions. Disabling image loading entirely or switching to a backup service (if we had one) were on the brainstorming table.
15:05 PST: The plot takes a heroic turn! The image delivery service vanquishes their evil gremlins and restores their service. Huzzah!
15:07 PST: Our website, finally free from its image amnesia, starts serving up beautiful product photos once again.
The Root Cause and the Not-So-Epic Fix
The culprit behind this image fiasco? A gremlin infestation (well, not literally) within the image delivery service. Their service disruption caused a ripple effect, leaving our website bereft of product pictures.
As for the fix? Unfortunately, it wasn't as exciting as slaying a dragon. We had to wait for the image delivery service to fix their own internal issues. But hey, at least things are back to normal now!
Learning from Our Mistakes (Hopefully)
This incident served as a stark reminder of the importance of:
Superhero Monitoring: We need even more powerful monitoring tools that can differentiate between our own website woes and external service meltdowns.
Backup Brigade: Redundancy is key! Exploring a backup image delivery service would give us a safety net in case our primary service goes rogue again.
Communication Cavalry: A well-defined communication strategy for outages is essential. We need a clear plan to inform everyone involved (internally and, potentially, externally) when things go south.
The End (Hopefully Happily Ever After)
By strengthening our monitoring, exploring redundancy options, and having a communication plan in place, we can weather future storms and ensure our website never suffers from image amnesia again. Let's keep those product photos looking sharp and our customers happy!
